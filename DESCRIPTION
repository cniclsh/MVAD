Description: This package is used to evaluate the distance of residuals from estimated 
    VAR(k) models error distributions using Mahalanobis and conditional probabilities on 
    real-time, high-frequency, multivariate data streams. 
    A use-case and example of how to find the input parameters can be found from 
    our arxiv paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.06316.
